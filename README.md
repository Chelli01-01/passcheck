# passcheck (Day 1)

A simple Python password strength checker that analyzes:
- length
- character variety (upper/lower/digits/symbols)
- estimated entropy
- weak patterns (sequences like `1234` and repeats like `aaaa`)

> Password input is hidden in the terminal.

## Run
```bash
python password_checker.py
